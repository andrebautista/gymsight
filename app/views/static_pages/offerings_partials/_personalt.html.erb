      <h1>Program Description</h1>
      <p>Gymsight Training offers personal training instruction for those who may want or need
a more concentrated approach in order to reach a particular outcome. All personal
training is individualized and based on individual, sport or mission specific goals. A
training cycle may begin with a client/trainer consultation in order to assess personal
requirements. After this we work on correcting any imbalances and or rehabilitating injury
if present, then we begin developing work capacity that will progressively increase
in intensity to sharpen our clients bodies and performance capability.</p>
